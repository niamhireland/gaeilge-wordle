# 🎓 Gaeilge Wordle Game

🇮🇪 *A digital Gaeilge game for Irish classrooms.* 

## 📚 About the project

This is a personal project aimed at supporting primary school teachers in Ireland with fun, digital Irish-language tools. It kicks off with a Wordle-style guessing game built in React, using the Irish alphabet and designed for classroom interactivity.

The project is currently pinned on my GitHub as an active work-in-progress 🛠️. You're very welcome to test it out or fork it — just mind the bugs and excuse the design quirks (for now!). Feedback is very welcome 💌

I'm aiming to deploy a full suite of tools by the 2025/2026 school year. The focus is on making accessible, engaging (and free!) resources for Seachtain na Gaeilge but it would be great if it gets wider use. 

## 🎯 Goals:

This application will (eventually):

+ 🧠 Provide a Wordle-style word guessing game as Gaeilge.
+ 🧑‍🏫 Allow teachers to input custom words or use preset daily options.
+ 🎹 Feature a clickable, on-screen Irish keyboard.
+ 🌗 Include a dark mode toggle.
+ 🧩 Act as the first of a broader set of interactive Gaeilge tools for Irish schools.
