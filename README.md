# About the project

This is a personal project designed and built to support primary school teachers in Ireland. The aim of the project is to create an interactive, digital set of Irish-language games and classroom tools, beginning with a Wordle-style guessing game built in React.

This version of the game is targeted at senior primary pupils and their teachers, offering simple and fun ways to engage with Gaeilge through modern tech. 

This project is pinned on my GitHub as an active personal project. You're welcome to download or test it out â€” but please note it's a work in progress. Feedback is very welcome, and bug forgiveness is appreciated!

I anticipate deploying a suite of applications for the upcoming (2025/2026) school year. 

# The application will:

+ Provide a Wordle-style word guessing game in Irish.
+ Support on-screen keyboard interaction using the Irish alphabet.
+ Allow for teacher-generated custom words as well as preset daily options.
+ Offer a dark mode toggle.
+ Be the first of a series of interactive tools for Seachtain na Gaeilge celebrations.
